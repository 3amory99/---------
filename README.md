## We have two methods available for string comparison, those are overloads of 𝚜𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐.𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚎 method which takes three parameters two strings and comparison case. As per the docs Microsoft suggests to use 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚘𝚗.𝙾𝚛𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚊𝚕 and 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚘𝚗.𝙾𝚛𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚊𝚕𝙸𝚐𝚗𝚘𝚛𝚎𝙲𝚊𝚜𝚎 for string comparison.

### 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚘𝚗.𝙾𝚛𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚊𝚕 : Use it when you need better performance comparison and you care about case sensitivity.
### 𝚂𝚝𝚛𝚒𝚗𝚐𝙲𝚘𝚖𝚙𝚊𝚛𝚒𝚜𝚘𝚗.𝙾𝚛𝚍𝚒𝚗𝚊𝚕𝙸𝚐𝚗𝚘𝚛𝚎𝙲𝚊𝚜𝚎 : Use it when case sensitivity is not needed.
